# Project Overview

## Project Name

Broken Stars

## Project Description

Broken Stars is a brainstorming app for all artists to find more inspiration to continue creating new work. This will be done in three phases. When started, the user first will be present with a prompt. This prompt will be of their choosing (it would be either a series of pictures and/or a quote provided depending on the user's choosing) After a 5 min session to write a stream of consciousness, the user will then log whichever words or phrases interest them into an unordered list for their own record. The user will then be challenged to try to start creating a new work (whether it's a song, painting, drawing, poem, prose, etc.).

## API and Data Sample

### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP 


- Find and use external api (Pixabay currently)
- Have a prompt appear at random when the user begins to use the app
- Allow a clock countdown for the user to begin their prompt
- When the clock hits zero, have the user begin to annotate their stream of consciousness and be able to log it into the unordered list 
- And have another open prompt for the writer to begin writing their own work for their next piece song, poem, book, etc.

#### PostMVP  


- Add second API (quotes or prompt) to offer differentiation in the prompts
- I do want to make a star design in the background to make them shoot as the user progress 
- To be able to save whatever the final result is from this type of writing sequence.

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

## Timeframes

This will track my estimation on how much time I will be spending on. I think this how long each aspect of this app will take as it is a fairly simple design. 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Working with API / Rendering Data | H | 7 hrs |  |  |
| Other JS Work (Click Functions, Words List, and Ending Prose) | H | 7 hrs | | |
| CSS Design and Animation | M | 6.5 hrs | | |
| HTML Structure | L | 2 hrs | | |
| Phone Media Query | M | 2.5 hrs | | |
| Post-MVP Work | L | 5 hrs | | |
| Total | H | 30 hrs |  |  |
